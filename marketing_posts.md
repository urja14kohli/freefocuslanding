## Option 1: The Confession

ok confession time
i have literally mass applications due and what do i do? open youtube "for a quick break" 47 times
so i did what any unhinged developer would do
i built an extension that closes the tab and goes "no. you said you were doing [task]. get back to work."
it's called lockdin and it's honestly saving my life rn
anyone else need their browser to parent them?? 🫠

## Option 2: The Toxic Bestie

what if your browser was a toxic friend who actually held you accountable
like you open twitter and it goes "babe no. you literally just said you were working on your thesis"
and then closes the tab
that's what i built. it's unhinged. it works.
drop a 🔒 if you'd use this

## Option 3: The ADHD Brain

my brain: ok time to lock in and work
also my brain: but what if we just checked reddit for 2 seconds
also my brain: *3 hours later*

so i built lockdin
now my browser literally closes twitter/youtube/reddit when i try to open them during focus mode
it's like having a disappointed parent watching over your shoulder but make it aesthetic

## Option 4: The Build in Public

building in public day 1:
made a chrome extension bc i have the attention span of a goldfish

it's called lockdin and it:
• asks "what are you working on?"
• blocks distracting sites when you're focusing
• literally closes the tab if you try to cheat

thinking of dropping it on chrome store
would you use this or am i the only one with zero discipline 😭

## Option 5: The Short King

i made my browser bully me into being productive
it's called lockdin
you set a focus → it blocks distractions → you actually get work done for once
releasing soon. want early access?
🔒 = yes

## Option 6: The Unhinged Thread

thread: i built something unhinged and i need to share

1/ so i have this problem where i'll be "working" but somehow end up 47 tabs deep into youtube shorts

2/ normal people would use willpower. i am not normal people.

3/ so i coded an extension called lockdin that literally closes distracting tabs and goes "you said you were doing [task]. focus."

4/ it's been 3 days and i've actually finished things?? like real things??

5/ thinking of releasing it publicly
rt if you need this level of accountability in your life 🔒

## Option 7: The Relatable Queen

me: i'm going to be so productive today
me 5 mins later: watching a video essay about the lore of club penguin

anyway i built an extension that roasts me when i do this
it's called lockdin and it might be the only thing standing between me and academic failure
who else needs their browser to be their accountability partner 😭

# 🔥 SPICY / CONTROVERSIAL TAKES 🔥

These are designed to start arguments in the comments (engagement = reach)

## Option 8: The "Apps Are a Scam" Take

unpopular opinion: productivity apps are a scam

notion won't make you productive
todoist won't make you productive
buying a $400 planner won't make you productive

you know what works? blocking twitter so you literally can't open it

i built lockdin bc i was tired of pretending fancy apps were the solution
the solution is removing the problem entirely
fight me in the replies 👇

## Option 9: The "Discipline is Dead" Take

hot take: discipline is fake and willpower is a finite resource

telling someone to "just focus" is like telling someone with glasses to "just see better"

so instead of relying on willpower i built an extension that makes distraction literally impossible
it's called lockdin and it's for people who've accepted they need guardrails not motivation

the self-improvement bros are gonna hate this one 🫠

## Option 10: The "Call Out Big Tech" Take

youtube, tiktok, and twitter spend billions engineering their apps to hijack your attention

you think you're "just checking" for 5 mins but their entire algorithm is designed to trap you

the game is rigged. so i stopped playing fair.

built an extension that force-closes these apps when i'm supposed to be working
it's called lockdin and it's the only thing that's actually worked
→ [link]

we're literally fighting billion dollar companies with our bare willpower and wondering why we lose

---

## Option 11: The "Grindset Bros Are Wrong" Take

the "wake up at 4am cold shower no excuses" crowd isn't going to like this

but most productivity advice is written by people who don't actually struggle with focus

some of us need actual barriers not just "discipline"
some of us need our browser to physically stop us from opening reddit

that's why i built lockdin
it's not motivational. it's mechanical.

## Option 12: The "Generational" Hot Take

gen z: "i can't focus on anything"
also gen z: has 47 tabs open, youtube in background, phone next to laptop, netflix on the tv

we're not broken. we're just overstimulated.

i built lockdin to force single-tasking mode. it blocks distractions so you can actually finish something for once.

(watch the millennials say "just put your phone down" like that's groundbreaking advice 💀)

## Option 13: The "Therapy is Expensive" Take

therapy: $200/hour
productivity coaching: $500/month
waitlist for meds: 6 months

my chrome extension that literally closes twitter when i procrastinate: free

sometimes the solution doesn't need to be complicated

## Option 14: The Pure Chaos Option

i built an extension that cyberbullies me into being productive and honestly it's the healthiest relationship i have rn

it's called lockdin
it judges me
it closes my tabs
it reminds me i'm a failure if i try to watch youtube during work hours

10/10 would recommend this toxic dynamic
